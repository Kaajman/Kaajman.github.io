	<h1 class="obsceneclass1"> The XV-104 battlesuit </h1>
	<p class="paragraph"> The XV104 Riptide Battlesuit is one of the latest T'au Earth Caste innovations, designed to combat the most dangerous enemies of the T'au Empire.

Standing twice the height of an XV8 Crisis Battlesuit, its long, back-jointed legs hold up a heavily armoured torso that houses the Riptideâ€™s Dark Matter Nova Reactor -- an experimental power generator that can be activated should the shas'vre pilot require extra power to sustain his heavy rate of fire.

The XV104 carries a sleek Riptide Shield Generator on one arm and a Heavy Burst Cannon, which can be exchanged for an Ion Accelerator, on the other. To provide manoeuvrability, the XV104 Riptide Battlesuit is also equipped with a large Jetpack that juts out from its shoulder blades.

A Riptide's pilot is an elite shas'vre -- chosen to don the mightiest battlesuit and fight for his cadre mates; he is an exemplar amongst his peers. On the battlefield, a Riptide can jet quickly to plug gaps in T'au lines and give covering fire for its colleagues whilst shielding its allies with its armoured bulk.</p>

	<h2 class="anotherclass"> XV-104 history</h2>
	<p class ="paragraph">Since the start of the Third Sphere Expansion, rumours of a new, heavy class of T'au Battlesuit had spread throughout the ranks of the Fire Caste. There was initially no appearance of this long-awaited latest prototype, but that changed during the expansion's first big showdown with the Imperium of Mankind on the Imperial world of Agrellan.

  </p>
	<p class ="paragraph">The Human armies had amassed and dug in to protect their Hive World; a situation that would normally call for the T'au to concentrate their forces on other, less fortified worlds. However, as the gateway planet to the whole of the coveted Dovar System, Agrellan was a keystone no invader could afford to bypass -- its orbit blocked the best route through the largely impassable Damocles Gulf, and so it had to be taken.

  </p>
	<p class ="paragraph">The Imperial defensive positions surrounding each hive city were formidable -- heavy walls topped at regular intervals with ferro-concrete bunkers overlooked the open wastelands. These killing fields were strewn with impenetrable tank traps and gravity-mines.

  </p>
	<p class ="paragraph">Should the T'au force their way through these perimeters, or simply airdrop within the fortified rings, they would find themselves within the claustrophobic and twisting streets of the great hive city itself. There, specially prepared blockades and defensive citadels awaited the unwary, with infantry and armour garrisoned within to launch counterattacks. It was a planet entirely given over to defending itself -- its whole population geared either for war, or for war production.

  </p>
	<p class ="paragraph">To crack this formidable planet and open up the more vulnerable systems beyond, Commander Shadowsun herself planned and launched the assault. Twenty Hunter Cadres would simultaneously strike key hive nodes, and at the vanguard of each strode the cutting edge of Earth Caste weapons technology, and the pinnacle of their battlesuit development -- the XV104 Riptide.

  </p>

	<p class ="paragraph">Heavy Burst Cannons, the Riptide's standard main armament, raked the walls, stitching patterns of death that cut Imperial Guardsmen in two. Missiles, from the Riptide's secondary weapon systems and from its accompanying Shielded Missile Drones, blazed outwards, leaving contrails as they streaked into the enemy's ranks. To the rear, those Riptides outfitted with the Ion Accelerator showed off the range and hitting power of their prototype weapons -- destroying battle tanks and blowing chunks out of the reinforced bunkers.

  </p>
	<p class ="paragraph">Amidst the rain of incoming ordnance and the blossoming of explosions, the distinctive thrumming sound of the Riptides overcharging their Nova Reactors could be heard. The very air crackled with electrical pulses due to the sheer energy generated by these indomitable power-packs. The massed guns of the Imperial Guard quickly targeted the giant Battlesuits, but to little avail. Near the gates of the prime hive, a battery of incoming Deathstrike Missiles momentarily lit the battlefield as they crashed into T'au lines. For a long moment it seemed as if both sides paused; only an XV104 Riptide, protected by its Nova Shield, emerged from the flaming crater, black scorch marks marring its armour, all it had to show for its brush with destruction.

  </p>
	<p class ="paragraph">Upon reaching the walls, the Riptides either engaged their Jetpacks to hurdle the impediment, or stepped through the breaches made by repeated blasts from their Ion Accelerators. With Fire Warriors advancing at their feet, the streets of every hive on Agrellan soon ran red with blood. Their defence and spirit broken, Guardsmen fled their posts in a complete rout. Only the lenient surrender terms offered by the Water Caste saved an all-out massacre. Before the sun set, except for a few desperate pockets that would soon be wiped out, the planet belonged to the T'au, who would rename the planet Mu'gulath Bay. Later, it would serve as the foundation of a new T'au Sept. So began the auspicious debut of the highly anticipated XV104 Riptide.

	<h2 class="anotherclass"> Variants</h2>
	<h2 class="cyanD"> XV107 Rvarna battlesuit</h2>
	<p class ="paragraph">  The XV107 R'varna Battlesuit is a rare variant of the recently introduced XV104 Riptide Battlesuit, and mounts two Pulse Submunitions Cannons as its main armament. These are experimental weapon systems which fire micro-cluster projectiles capable of saturating a wide target area with a deadly storm of plasma pulses. The R'varna has far heavier armour than its more mobile, Jetpack-equipped Riptide counterpart, allowing the pilot to stand firm in the face of any foe whilst the more mobile elements of this Hunter Cadre envelop and destroy them.</p>
	<h2 class="cyanD"> XV109 Rvarna battlesuit</h2>
	<p class ="paragraph">  Rushed into deployment after the success of the XV107 R'varna Battlesuit, the XV109 Y'vahra is a Class 10 Battlesuit designed for devastating frontline shock assaults. To facilitate this role, the Y'vahra is equipped with a triple-barrelled Phased Plasma-Flamer capable of vaporising even hardened ceramite, and a massive Ionic Discharge Cannon designed to incapacitate enemy war engines. The complex Vectored Thruster Array incorporated into the Y'vahra's impressive armour allows it to traverse the battlefield in long graceful bounds, slamming into the greatest concentration of the enemy and reaping a heavy toll in lives before jetting away.</p>
