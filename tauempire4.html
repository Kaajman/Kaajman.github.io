	<h1 class="obsceneclass1"> What are Sept Worlds </h1>
	<p class="paragraph"> Each sept of the Tau Empire has its unique cultural identity wholly integrated within the greater Tau culture. This cultural identity seems to mainly derive from which Tau caste is more numerous and influential in the given sept. Currently there are over twenty fully developed septs. Each sept has its own sept symbol. Like any distant colony, much of the wargear, armour and other technology used by those within the Farsight Enclaves is slightly dated compared to present-day Fire Caste armouries -- the equipment most prevalent at the time of Farsight's disappearance. There has been, however, unsettling evidence of classified technology and recent T'au prototypes present within the Enclaves. Time will tell whether this is the result of spycraft, theft or traitors to the Greater Good who have been aiding those within Farsight's domain.

	<h2 class="anotherclass"> The Farsight enclaves</h2>
	<p class="paragraph"> The Farsight Enclaves, known as the "Forbidden Zone" in the T'au Empire, are a series of heavily-fortified T'au colony worlds that are independent and indeed opposed to the rule of the T'au Empire and its Ethereals. They are ruled by the legendary Fire Caste Shas'O Vior'la Shovah Kais Mont'yr, known to the Imperium as Commander Farsight, and lie on the far side of the Damocles Gulf region of the Segmentum Ultima in the Eastern Fringe of the Milky Way Galaxy.</p>
	<p class="paragraph"> The T'au Empire launches many probes towards what the T'au have named the "Forbidden Zone," the cluster of star systems beyond the far side of the Damocles Gulf in the Eastern Fringe, although few have ever returned. The strange eddies and unreadable energies that drift in that region doubtlessly damage or reroute a portion of those lost probes, but many more are destroyed by the Farsight Enclaves' orbital defence stations that blockade all entry, save only for their own voidships.</p>
	<p class="paragraph"> Beyond that formidable ring of floating fortresses are the Farsight Enclaves themselves. Scans from those few T'au probes to successfully beam back signals reveal a string of heavily built-up worlds with large populations, including nodal cities expanded from colony domes and entire moonbases converted to manufacturing.

</p>
	<p class="paragraph"> When last seen trailing the Orks who were the target of his original military expedition into the wilds of the Damocles Gulf Terran centuries ago, Farsight's Coalition bore the symbols of their original Septs -- predominately Vior'la, but also Sa'cea, Tau'n and several others. When sighted generations later, these forces and fleets bore markings similar in design to those used by the T'au Empire, but in colours and patterns never sanctioned by the Ethereal High Council.
