	<h1 class="obsceneclass1"> The XV-8 series battlesuits </h1>
	<p class="paragraph"> The XV8 Crisis Battlesuit is the mainstay general combat T'au Battlesuit utilised by the warriors of the Fire Caste of the T'au Empire. It mounts a vast array of fearsome ranged weaponry as well as a complement of technologically advanced support systems on a comparatively small and agile frame that offers the T'au pilot within exceptional protection. Of all the weapons systems employed by the T'au, the XV8 Crisis Battlesuit is easily the most distinctive and recognisable due to its reputation as an efficient and lethal weapon of war. The XV8 Crisis Battlesuit strikes a perfect balance between offensive capability, armoured protection, speed, manoeuvrability and utility. It is a towering T'au Battlesuit, easily twice the size of the Fire Warrior who wears it. A wonder of Earth Caste engineering, only the T'au could master the secrets of producing the dense nanocrystalline alloy that forms the thick protective armour of the XV8. When it comes to deflecting and withstanding damage, the XV8's armour is comparable to the ceramite used by the Imperium of Man's Space Marines, but weighs substantially less.

	<h2 class="anotherclass"> XV-8 variants</h2>
	
	<h2 class="cyanD">XV8-02 Crisis Iridium Battlesuit
</h2>
	<p class ="paragraph">The XV8-02 Crisis Iridium Battlesuit was developed following the death of Commander Pridestar to a sniper's bullet and the subsequent rout of Fire Caste warriors during the Klodate Worlds Suppression. After this tragic event, the Earth Caste developed an experimental iridium alloy that was used to produce enough armour plates to reinforce a small series of battlesuits.

The XV8-02 prototype offers T'au Commanders and their bodyguards optimal protection that is by far superior compared to the armour of the standard XV8 Crisis Battlesuit, and is often given to particularly valuable leaders to prevent future attempts at assassination by the enemy.

</p>
	<h2 class="cyanD">XV81 Crisis Battlesuit
</h2>
	<p class ="paragraph">The XV81 Battlesuit was designed in an attempt the counter the high casualty rate amongst T'au Commanders, whose zeal in battle often led to them being exposed to enemy fire whilst in support of their troops.

Its back mounted Smart Missile System allows the pilot to suppress enemy forces without leaving themselves vulnerable, and is intended to be used as a long-range fire support platform.

Note that this Smart Missile System does not make use of a battlesuit hard-point, allowing the suit to retain its full complement of other weapons and combat support systems.</p>
	<h2 class="cyanD">XV84 Crisis Battlesuit
 </h2>
	<p class ="paragraph">The XV84 Crisis Battlesuit is equipped with a spine-mounted Marker Light and Target Lock sensor support system to enhance its target acquisition capabilities in combat against multiple foes. Together, these additional systems fill up only a single XV8 Battlesuit hard-point.

Pilots issued with this battlesuit variant are often called upon to fight away from the support of the rest of their cadre, whether buying time for their comrades to retreat and redeploy, or undertaking a surprise assault on the enemy.  </p>
	<h2 class="cyanD"> XV85 Enforcer Battlesuit
</h2>
	<p class ="paragraph">The XV85 Enforcer Battlesuit is a larger and sleeker variant of the standard XV8 Crisis Battlesuit that provides better protection and joint movement for the pilot, and can mount additional support systems or weapons due to its more powerful reactor.

It is produced in limited numbers, and is issued almost exclusively to T'au Commanders. The XV85 is favoured by many as its distinctive design allows allies and enemies alike to quickly identify its wearer as a warrior to be feared and respected.

  </p>
	<h2 class="cyanD"> XV86 Coldstar Battlesuit
</h2>
	<p class ="paragraph"> The XV86 Coldstar Battlesuit, or simply the XV86, is a rare mark of XV8 Crisis Battlesuit that carries many wholly unique support and weapon systems. Designed for operation in a void environment, each XV86 is fitted with integrated interface armour.

XV86 Coldstar Battlesuits feature enhanced Jetpack designs which allow them to achieve something akin to true extended flight, and their armour is layered with super-insulating carbodine mesh and integral heat-shielding so that they can handle the heat of atmospheric re-entry and the icy cold of the void.

So far, all known XV86 Coldstar Battlesuits have been deployed with a weapons loadout consisting of a high-yield Burst Cannon and a shoulder-mounted Missile Pod, with space for two additional Battlesuit Support Systems. </p>
	<h2 class="cyanD">XV89 Crisis Battlesuit
 </h2>
	<p class ="paragraph">The XV89 Crisis Battlesuit was intended for assaults against heavily-fortified enemy positions and thus is outfitted with the heavy Iridium Armour modification for enhanced protection compared to the standard XV8 Crisis Battlesuit.

Initially deployed during the fighting on Taros during the Taros Campaign, it was soon found that the XV89's bulky armour plating limited its manoeuvrability, leaving those shas'vre assigned to it unable to fulfil the traditional role of XV8 Crisis Teams.

Based on reports compiled after the Taros Campaign, the design was abandoned in favour of the XV8-02 Iridium Battlesuit and hundreds of XV89 Battlesuits that had been deployed for testing were recalled and had their armour stripped down, before being reassigned to XV8 Crisis teams in need of replacement suits.

Many cadres operating on the outer fringes of the T'au Empire's expansion zone, however, have been observed by Imperial military forces and Rogue Traders still equipped with the distinctive XV89 variant battlesuits.  </p>
